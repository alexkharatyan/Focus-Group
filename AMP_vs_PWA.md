Almost every person in the world carries a smartphone device in their pockets. It’s an open and endless opportunity to business, which, however, is immediately challenged by an immense number of competitors in the mobile software market. Mobile apps are way better and convenient than desktop or web platforms. Yet, they are not the most comfortable option that the industry offers.

In the web development industry, the sky's the limit. And you will see many growth factors and technologies in it. To hit the highest level of user satisfaction and to outrun competitors, inventive people opt-in favor of Progressive Web App (PWA) or Accelerated Mobile Page (AMP).

## What’s PWA?
PWA stands for Progressive Web App which provides the look and feel, and the experience of a mobile application by accessing its web pages on a browser.

PWAs offer various features like Rich Offline Experience, Periodic Background Syncs and Push Notifications which help users to revisit your website.

In a nutshell, PWA is an optimized web page to provide app-like functionalities like faster transition, a complete interface, push notifications, and offline accessibility. Without installing its mobile application, PWA works when a platform or its services are accessed on the mobile web.

For better understanding, let’s give you an example of Twitter. Well, Twitter is the company that’s using PWAs. When you open the web version on your phone and install the app, add it to your home screen. When you open the Twitter app from the home screen icon, that will be opened as a progressive web app.

Even the mobile websites of Amazon and Flipkart look and feel exactly like their mobile app. This is PWA.

In 2015, Google developed Progressive Web Apps. PWA adheres to the three criteria:

- Reliable: Load instantly even in uncertain network conditions.
- Fast: Respond quickly and hassle-free to user interaction with smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
- Engaging: Natural app on the device with immersive user experience.

## Characteristics of PWA

- Responsive web design
- Can work in an offline and update as quickly as possible
- With an app shell model, it looks like a mobile app
- Progressive enhancement for user engagement
- Always comes with an HTTPS certificate that encrypts your data between the browser and the webserver
- Access the re-engagement UIs of the operating system through push notifications feature
- Search Engine Results (SERPs) friendly
- Can be readily shared in the form of URL and link
- Increases page load speed with faster content downloading

## Advantages of PWA

Developing Progressive Web App has several advantages, which, eventually, helps to increase engagement and improves conversion rate.

- **Responsive**: PWAs are responsive and compatible with any device, whether it’s a tablet, desktop, mobile or any other device.

- **SEO-friendly**: PWA works friendly and smoothly with search engines. It usually increases app searchability and accessibility. Since the websites load faster, the chances of rankings get higher.

- **Affordable**: The expenses of PWA development costs a lot lesser as compared to other native mobile applications for Android and iOS. You can generate more businesses with many functions at a lesser price.

- **No Updates**: The mobile apps occupy your mobile data and space due to the updates. However, you will no longer receive any update on a daily basis with PWA. It only gets an update when the websites are getting updated.

- **Data Consumption**: PWA consists of very little information compared to other mobile apps. Hence, purchasing the data is less expensive. Therefore, no extra storage is required in the device.


## Disadvantages of PWA
PWA offers many advantages over native applications. But when it comes to integration or using the hardware device features it has some limitations.

- They don’t support all native features
- Not all devices support the complete software functionality
- Call features without the Dialer dialog
- Doesn’t support cross-app logins
- Due to platform limitations it re-engages issues
- Access to sensor and hardware features
- Not supported by every browser
- Not supported by all hardware functionality
- Modify logs or system settings

## When Should You Choose Progressive Web Apps?

- If you are planning to develop an app from scratch, then PWA is the best option for you. It’s an app type such as a native or hybrid app. That means from scratch, you have to follow the process of app development. It’s like any other web or mobile app development process but comes with advanced web capabilities.
- If you have a budget constraint for native app development and also want to provide a unified experience to app users, PWA is the right choice for you. The development cost of PWA is lesser than native apps.

# What’s AMP?

AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Page. AMP is an open-source project, approved by Google which allows developers to build web pages that load faster on mobile devices. It improves the page-loading performance of web pages. Hence, you can get an outstanding and faster browsing experience on mobile devices.

The language of AMP is a stripped-down version of CSS and HTML that restricts the use of JavaScript.

AMPs are simple as it contains 10 times fewer data than a usual website or app. Therefore, it gives you informative content in the shortest possible time. It’s like you put your demand and the solution will be provided to you in a jiffy.

In recent times, AMP has been widely used for creating web pages that can load almost instantly. The open-source library is compatible across browsers and supports several platforms.
